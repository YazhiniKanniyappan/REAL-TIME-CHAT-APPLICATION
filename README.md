# TASK 2 - 💬REAL TIME CHAT APPLICATION - DESCRIPTION :

Real-time chat applications play a vital role in modern communication. Whether it's customer support, social interaction, or collaboration platforms, the ability to send and receive messages instantly enhances user experience. This project aims to simulate such an environment with a simple and scalable architecture using React and WebSockets.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

During the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

- Building a WebSocket server using Node.js
- Setting up real-time communication between frontend and backend
- Structuring React projects and creating modular components
- Managing application state using React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Handling user input and rendering live message updates
- Creating a mobile-friendly layout using CSS Flexbox and media queries
- Debugging asynchronous, real-time data flows

This project significantly improved my confidence in building responsive and interactive full-stack applications.
